//! Abstraction of window setup, OpenGL context creation and event handling.
//!
//! Implemented using the sdl2 crate (a Rust wrapper for SDL2). All usage of
//! SDL should be confined to this module.
//!
//! There is currently no separation of concerns between a single window and
//! window system interaction in general, because it is assumed only one window
//! will be needed for the runtime of the app.
